Documentation: Setting Up OTP Authentication with QR Code
1. Overview
This script sets up One-Time Password (OTP) authentication for your application using the otplib and qrcode libraries. The process involves generating a secret key, creating a URI in the otpauth:// format, and generating a QR code that users can scan with apps like Google Authenticator.
________________________________________
2. Steps Explained
1.	Install Dependencies: Before running the script:
 
            npm install 
2.	Generate a Secret Key
o	A secret key is created for the user using otplib.authenticator.generateSecret().
o	This key should be stored securely (e.g., in a database) as it will be needed for OTP validation.
3.	Create the Key URI
o	The key URI (otpauth:// format) is created using otplib.authenticator.keyuri(user, service, secret).
o	The URI includes the user's identifier, the application's name, and the secret key.
4.	Generate the QR Code
o	The QR code is generated from the key URI using the qrcode library.
o	The QR code is output as a base64 string, which can be embedded in an HTML page or displayed in an image tag.
5.	Scan the QR Code
o	The user scans the QR code using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator.
o	The app will store the key and generate OTPs for login or other verification processes.

3. Key Points
•	Secret Key: This must be securely stored and kept confidential to prevent unauthorized OTP generation.
•	QR Code: Simplifies onboarding by allowing users to quickly set up OTP generation in their app.
•	Key URI: The otpauth:// URI follows a standard that is compatible with most OTP applications.
4. Command to run the script to generate Secret key and QR code.
 
node generateOtp.js
5. Command to run the script to validate OTP.
 
node verifyotp.js
How OTP Works
1. Shared Secret Key
•	When you scan the QR code or manually enter the secret key in your phone, the app stores the secret key.
•	This secret key is the foundation for generating OTPs, both on the server and in the user's app.
2. Time Synchronization
•	Time-based One-Time Password TOTP is based on the current time.
•	Both the app and the server use a common time source (typically UTC) to generate the OTP.
•	The time is divided into fixed intervals (usually 30 seconds) called time steps.
3. Generating the OTP
•	At each time step, both the app and the server compute a hash using:
o	The secret key.
o	The current time step.
•	The hash output is truncated to produce a 6-digit (or longer) OTP.
•	Since the app and server use the same algorithm, secret key, and time synchronization, they generate identical OTPs.

Why OTP Works Offline
•	No Network Dependency:
o	Once the secret key is stored in the app, it doesn't need to contact the server to generate OTPs.
o	The OTP generation relies only on:
	The local clock.
	The stored secret key.
o	As long as your phone's clock is reasonably accurate, the app can compute the correct OTP even without an internet connection.
•	Clock Synchronization:
o	TOTP assumes that the server's and app's clocks are synchronized.
o	Most modern devices regularly synchronize their clocks with internet-based time servers, ensuring accuracy.
o	If the clock drifts significantly, OTPs might fail. However, some servers account for slight time deviations (e.g., ±1 time step).
